# Usage
Our final project contains two primary aspects.  Shift-scheduling and ride acception thresholds for Uber drivers.

## Shift-Scheduling
After a sports game, people know to call Uber rides in advance.  Everybody understands demand.  

Similarly, Uber-drivers know that weekend nights are usually good nights to drive.  But, what about the rest of the week?  Should a driver work at 2pm on a Tuesday or 10am on a Thursday?

Based on our scheduling recommendations, a driver can input the date and see the expected demand distribution.  This allows drivers to make more informed decisions and increase overall revenue.

### Validation
In order to test our distribution projection against human intuition, we surveyed X people about expected Uber demand throughout random weeks.  Here are the results:

## Ride Acception Thresholds
In maximizing hourly profit, it is advantageous for drivers to only accept rides with a reasonable payout, relative to the time and distance required.  That being said, what if there isn't much demand?  What if there's an extraordinary amount of demand?  How does one determine which rides to accept?

This is where ride acception thresholds play a role.  Based on the date, ride distance, and passenger count, we are able to predict a reasonable fare price given past data.

By combining our ability to predict ride revenue with our ability to model demand, we can make more reasonable assumptions...
